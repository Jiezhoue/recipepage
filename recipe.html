        <h2>Fried Rice</h2>

           <ol>
               <li>
                   Place the rice into a fine sieve and wash with water to remove excess starch.
               </li>
               <li>
Drain the water and place the rice into a saucepan. Add the water. Heat the rice over high heat until the water starts boiling. Then reduce the heat to medium and cook until you can see the rice grain starting to rise above the water. Then cover with a lid that is slightly ajar to let some of the steam escape. Cook for 5 minutes.               </li>
               <li>
After 5 minutes it should look like all of the water has been absorbed by the rice. Turn the heat off and cover completely with the lid. Allow the pot to sit on the warm hotplate for 10 minutes to allow the steam to continue cooking the rice.               </li>
               <li>
Use a fork to fluff the rice grains and transfer to a large baking tray. Place the rice, uncovered, in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (overnight is best though) before using for fried rice.               </li>

            <ol>

                    <p>Heat a teaspoon of oil in a wok over medium heat and add a cup of raw shelled peanuts. Stir constantly (or they’ll burn) for 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir for another minute using the residual heat in the wok.</p>
                <li>MARINATE THE CHICKEN</li>
                    <p>Combine the chicken with 1 teaspoon each of oil, cornstarch, and Shaoxing wine, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of white pepper. Set aside to marinate for 20 minutes. For more information and preparing chicken for stir fries</p>
                <li>PREPARE THE SAUCE</li>
                <p>Mix together light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sugar, water, and cornstarch, and set aside.</p>
                <li>GRAB THE REST OF YOUR INGREDIENTS
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>

                        <li>2 dried red chilies, deseeded and chopped (these can be quite spicy, so adjust according to your own tastes)</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn powder</li>
                        <li>6 scallions, white portions only, cut into 3/4” pieces</li>

                </li>
                <p></p>

Turn up the heat to high and stir-fry for a minute.Then stir up your prepared sauce (the cornstarch will have settled to the bottom, so make sure it’s well incorporated).Add the sauce to the wok and stir-fry for another minute. The sauce should thicken very quickly.Finally, add the peanuts.Give everything a final stir and serve.

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For curry paste, finely grind spices with a mortar and pestle. Add remaining ingredients in order of toughness with ½ tsp salt, pounding them to a paste (alternatively, blend in a food processor until smooth, but the mortar and pestle will give you better colour and fragrance).</li>
                    <li>Heat lard in a large wok or saucepan over medium heat. Add curry paste and the head of coconut cream skimmed from top of can, and stir until fragrant and oil separates (12-15 minutes). Add coconut milk and simmer over low heat until thickened (30 minutes). Increase heat to high, add chicken and stock, cover with a lid and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked and flavour deepens (30 minutes). Add fish sauce, seasoning to taste, and stir in palm sugar and remaining coconut cream.</li>
                    <li>Increase heat to medium, then drain eggplant, add to wok, and simmer until tender (5 minutes). Remove from heat, stir in lime leaf, chilli and basil, and serve with rice.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Sticky Asian Wings</h2>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>mix the Chinese chicken wing marinade and pour over wings</li>
                    <li>marinade for a mere 10 to 15 minutes – don’t marinade for longer otherwise it will make the wings too salty and also makes the marinade watery (from drawing moisture out of the wings) which makes it harder to baste</li>
                    <li>Spread wings out on tray lined with foil and paper. Yes, use both. You’ll thank me later – when you’re sleeping tonight instead of scraping super-glued marinade off the tray</li>
                    <li>bake for 50 minutes until golden and sticky, basting 2 – 3 times with reserved marinade and tray juices</li>
                </ul>
